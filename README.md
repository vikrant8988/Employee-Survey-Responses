This project contains the results of an employee survey conducted within a company. The survey asked employees ten different questions to gauge their satisfaction, engagement, and perceptions related to various aspects of their work environment.

## Survey Questions

The survey included the following questions:

1. I know what is expected of me at work.
2. At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.
3. In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work.
4. My supervisor, or someone at work, seems to care about me as a person.
5. The mission or purpose of our organization makes me feel my job is important.
6. I have a best friend at work.
7. This last year, I have had opportunities at work to learn and grow.
8. My supervisor holds employees accountable for performance.
9. My department is inclusive and demonstrates support of a diverse workforce.
10. Overall, I am satisfied with my job.

## Conclusion

Based on the survey responses, one notable insight is that many employees strongly disagree with the statement "I have a best friend at work." This indicates that the company may benefit from fostering a more social and connected work environment, as having a "best friend at work" can significantly improve employee engagement and satisfaction.
